A personal repository to document and track my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Track progress and learning in DSA.
- Document patterns and their applications in problem-solving.
- Capture key insights, "gotchas", and conceptual breakthroughs.
- Focus on **deep understanding** and **pattern recognition** — not just syntax.

## 🧩 Key Components

- ✅ **Code Implementations**: Clean, modular code for each data structure and related problems.
- 🧠 **Pattern Notes**: Hand-crafted summaries on patterns like Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.
- 📌 **Problem Tracker**: Organized log of solved problems, categorized by topic and difficulty.
- 🛠️ **Snippets & Utilities**: Reusable helper functions and templates.

## 🌐 Profiles

- 📍 [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/siddharthtanwar/)

> “Most people say to recognize patterns — I aim to **break them down and document them** clearly.”
